# golocalize
**iOS community driven translations for the iPhone/iPad application FriendCash**


## Locales supported

_Crossed out languages are not yet fully implemented_

- English (en)
- French (fr)
- ~~Spanish (es)~~
- German (de) (Lukas Bestle, [lu-x.me](http://lu-x.me/))


## Contribute

New languages get a copy of the English files so that words not yet translated are easy to identify. Soon 
I'll add a tool to compute the progress of each translation.

### You are a developer ?

Make pull requests and I'll integrate it with pleasure.
